# scrollphathdticker
My latest Twitter ticker uses a Pimoroni <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/scroll-phat-hd">Scroll pHat HD</a>.

It has two buttons to choose whether to scroll news or weather tweets.

You can change the users it displays for each button press on lines 24 and 48.

The "count" variable on lines 27 and 50 decides how many tweets you'll see from the users in each group.

It needs to run in Python 3, so you'll have to type "python3 scrolltwitter.py" to get it to run. Thanks to @alexmburns for reminding me about this.

You'll need to get Twitter access tokens from <a href="http://apps.twitter.com">apps.twitter.com</a>.
